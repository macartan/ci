# Abstract

The course addresses advanced topics in causal inference and experimental design. It is a hands on course in which theoretical results are introduced through lecture, demonstrated in practice, and worked on in groups. Topics likely include sampling and randomization schemes, including multilevel trials, restricted randomization, and patient preference trials; Bayesian approaches to causal inference, exact inference: sharp nulls for complex hypotheses, inverting hypothesis tests, Mediation analysis, Multiple comparisons, Open science workflows.


# Expectations

* 5 tasks
* (Required) Work in four "exercise teams": 1 team (and typically 2 exercises) per session $\times 4$ 
* (Optional) Prepare a research design or short paper, perhaps building on existing work. Typically this contains: 
  - a problem statement
  - a description of a method to address the problem
  - analytic or simulation based results describing properties of the solution
  - a discussion of implications for practice. 
  - A passing paper will illustrate subtle features of a method; a good paper will identify unknown properties of a method; en excellent paper will develop a new method. 

* Plus general reading and participation. 

# Readings

The course is primarily lecture and exercise based. We will not discuss readings in class, though some are relevant for different exercises. I do recommend the readings both for giving background to the lectures and for going beyond the lectures. 

All readings are linked from this document. 

I will draw material especially from  two recent books I worked on, both open access:

* [Research Design in the Social Sciences](https://book.declaredesign.org/)
* [Integrated Inferences](https://macartan.github.io/integrated_inferences/)

I point a number of times to bits from this excellent draft text, also open access: 

* [@hernanwhatif](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2024/01/hernanrobins_WhatIf_2jan24.pdf)

See also the very useful:

* Cunningham's "[mixed tape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)" is a great accompanying read to fundamentals and topics:
* Pearl's [primer](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf)


Recommended non open access readings include:

* [@gerber2012field](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393979954) with supplementary material available here: [https://isps.yale.edu/FEDAI](https://isps.yale.edu/FEDAI)

# Prerequisites

You should already have background in statistics up to the point with feeling comfortable with regression. 

In addition you should know some `R`. Really, the more you can invest on getting on top of `R` before the class the better.  

* Resources for learning `R`: http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/

Please make sure your `R` is up-to-date and that you are working in `R studio`. Then make sure you have the following packages installed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(
  rstan, 
  dagitty, 
  DeclareDesign, 
  CausalQueries,
  ri2,
  tidyverse,
  knitr
  )
```


## File Sharing via Git

I encourage you to set up and send me your `git` user names and we can access all materials on github. The git contains slides and exercises but will also have a folder structure where group presentations can be stored.


## Writing with `Rmd` or `qmd`

Please plan to do drafting in `Quarto`.  This is a  simple markup language that lets you integrate writing and coding.  This document is written in `quarto` and the slides will be also. 

The key thing is that you can insert code chunks like this.

```{r}
# Define a random number
x <- rnorm(1)
```


Code like this is  run as the document compiles, and results can be accessed as needed, like this: we just sampled the random number $x =$ `r x`.

I recommend using `Rstudio` as an editor. More information here:
