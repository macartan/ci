# Puzzle

The exercise was:

> Generate a simple design with potential outcomes and display the potential outcomes in a table

## Answer: Design

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(DeclareDesign)
library(knitr)

design <- 
  declare_model(N = 4, 
                b = rnorm(N),
                potential_outcomes(Y ~ b*Z)) +
  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) +
  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z))

```

## Answer: Design

```{r, echo = TRUE}

draw_data(design) |> kable()

```

## Comment

We were wondering how DeclareDesign knew how to label  the potential outcome columns and then realised that default values were used for `Z`. 

Here is an example with alternative values.


## Alternative

```{r, echo = TRUE}
design_2 <- 
  declare_model(N = 4, 
                b = rnorm(N),
                potential_outcomes(Y ~ b*X, conditions = list(X = 0:1))) +
  declare_assignment(X = complete_ra(N)) +
  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ X))

draw_data(design_2) |> kable()
```
