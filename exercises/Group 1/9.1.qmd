#Print potential outcomes for all possible assignments

```{r}

#Calculate difference in means for each possible assignment

```{r}
diff_means <- apply(potential_outcomes, 2, mean) - potential_outcomes[, "Control"] print("Difference in Means for Each Possible Assignment:") print(diff_means)

#Define two estimands of interest

```{r}
estimand_1 <- "Average Treatment Effect (ATE)" estimand_2 <- "Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)" print("Estimands of Interest:") print(estimand_1) print(estimand_2)

#Define randomization scheme and answer strategy

```{r}

```

#Print unbiased estimate of each estimand

```{r}
