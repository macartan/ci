**False positives and Ns**

Sometimes people worry that with larger samples you are more likely to get a false positive. Is that true?

The concern is related to the concept of Type I error in hypothesis testing. A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. The significance level (often denoted by α) is the probability of making a Type I error.

In traditional hypothesis testing, as sample size increases, the statistical power of the test also increases. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., avoiding a Type II error). However, an increase in sample size does not directly affect the Type I error rate, which is typically set by the chosen significance level.

If you maintain the same significance level and only increase the sample size, you do not increase the probability of a Type I error. In fact, larger sample sizes generally provide more reliable and precise estimates of population parameters.

##################
Assess by generating a simple experimental design from scratch in which we can vary the N and in which there is no true effect of some treatment. 
##################

# Set a seed for reproducibility 
set.seed(123)

# Function to simulate data with no treatment effect 
generate_data <- function(N) { 
  control_group <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
  data <- data.frame(Group = rep("Control", N), Values = control_group) 
  return(data) 
}

##################
-> In this example, generate_data simulates a control group with no treatment effect, and data is generated for different sample sizes (N). The resulting simulations_df data frame contains the simulated data.

##################
Then: 
Plot the distribution of values from the simulations_df. What shape is it and why? 
##################
# Plot histogram of values
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(simulations_df, aes(x = Values)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Values", x = "Values", y = "Frequency")
##################

Plot the power as increases, using the diagnosands_df 

Assuming you have a diagnosands_df data frame with columns "N," "power," and possibly other relevant columns:
##################

# Plot power against N 
ggplot(diagnosands_df, aes(x = N, y = power)) + geom_line(color = "red") + labs(title = "Power vs. Sample Size (N)", x = "Sample Size (N)", y = "Power") 

#################
Plot the estimates against values for different values of ; what do you see? 

Assuming you have a data frame named estimates_df with columns "values," "estimates," and possibly other relevant columns:
#################
# Plot estimates against values for different values of 
ggplot(estimates_df, aes(x = values, y = estimates, color = factor(N))) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Estimates vs. Values for Different N", x = "Values", y = "Estimates", color = "Sample Size (N)") + theme_minimal()

Discussion
1.	Distribution of Values:
Since we simulated data with no treatment effect and sampled from a normal distribution, you would expect a symmetric bell-shaped distribution.
2.	Power vs. Sample Size:
Power is often expected to increase as the sample size increases, showing the ability to detect true effects.
3.	Estimates vs. Values for Different N:
Depending on the nature of the simulation, the observation of the estimates vary with different sample sizes.
