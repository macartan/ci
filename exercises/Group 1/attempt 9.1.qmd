**9.1 Spillovers**

Imagine a study with three subjects. Each subjectâ€™s potential outcomes are as follows:

-   0 if in control

-   n if in treatment when n subjects are assigned to treatment

So for example if one unit is in treatment that unit has outcome Y=1, and the others have Y = 0; if all 3 are in treatment they all have Y=3.

1.  Write down the potential outcomes for all possible assignments, including all and none assigned o treatment

2.  Write down the difference in means calculation for each possible assignment

3.  Define two estimands of interest.

4.  Define a randomization scheme and answer strategy that will return an unbiased estimate of each estimand.

| Treatment Assignments | Subject 1 | Subject 2 | Subject 3 | Diff in Means   |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Y_0_0_0**           | 0         | 0         | 0         | (Control Group) |
| **Y_0_0_1**           | 0         | 0         | 1         | 1/3             |
| **Y_0_1_0**           | 0         | 1         | 0         | 1/3             |
| **Y_0_1_1**           | 0         | 2         | 2         | 4/3             |
| **Y_1_0_0**           | 1         | 0         | 0         | 1/3             |
| **Y_1_0_1**           | 2         | 0         | 2         | 4/3             |
| **Y_1_1_0**           | 2         | 2         | 0         | 4/3             |
| **Y_1_1_1**           | 3         | 3         | 3         | 3               |

One of these is the direct average treatment effect:

\[Y_1_0_0 + Y_1_0_1 + Y_1_1_0 + Y_1_1_1\]/4 - \[Y_0_0_0 + Y_0_0_1 + Y_0_1_0 + Y_0_1_1\]/4

= 10/4 - 3/4 = 7/4 = 1.75

\[Y_1_0_0 + Y_1_0_1 + Y_1_1_0 + Y_1_1_1\]/4 - \[Y_0_0_0\]

= 10/4 - 0 = 2.5

ATT might also be an estimand of interest...?

1.  Define a randomization scheme and answer strategy that will return an unbiased estimate of each estimand.

Not sure.
