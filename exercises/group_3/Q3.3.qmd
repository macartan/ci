## Potential Outcomes

Consider a process with:

| X1  | X2  | Y   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

-   Say X1=1, X2=1. Then Y = 1. What caused Y = 1?

-   Say X1=0, X2=0. Then Y = 0. What caused Y = 0?

--- 

-   Say X1 = 1 with 10% probability, otherwise 0 and, independently, X2 = 1 with 50% probability, otherwise 0.

Then what is the average effect of X1 on Y? What is the average effect of X2 on Y? Which cause has the biggest effect?
