research purposes?}
\protect\hypertarget{constraint-is-it-ethical-to-manipulate-subjects-for-research-purposes}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is no foundationless answer to this question. So let's take some
  foundations from the Belmont report and seek to ensure:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Respect for persons
  \item
    Beneficence
  \item
    Justice
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Unfortunately, operationalizing these requires further ethical
  theories. Let's assume that (1) is operationalized by informed consent
  (a very liberal idea). We are a bit at sea for (2) and (3) (the
  Belmont report suggests something like a utilitarian solution).
\item
  The major focus on (1) by IRBs might follow from the view that if
  subjects consent, then they endorse the ethical calculations made for
  2 and 3 --- \emph{they} think that it is good and fair.
\item
  This is a little tricky, though, since the study may not be good or
  fair because of implications for non-subjects.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Is it ethical to manipulate subjects for research
purposes?}
\protect\hypertarget{is-it-ethical-to-manipulate-subjects-for-research-purposes}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The problem is that many (many) field experiments have nothing like
  informed consent.
\item
  For example, whether the government builds a school in your village,
  whether an ad appears on your favorite radio show, and so on.
\item
  Consider three cases:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You work with a nonprofit to post (true?) posters about the crimes
    of politicians on billboards to see effects on \textbf{voters}
  \item
    You hire confederates to offer bribes to \textbf{police officers} to
    see if they are more likely to bend the law for coethnics
  \item
    The British government asks you to work on figuring out how the use
    of water cannons helps stop \textbf{rioters} rioting
  \end{enumerate}

  \end{itemize}
\item
  In all cases, there is \textbf{no consent} given by subjects.
\item
  In 2 and 3, the treatment is \textbf{possibly harmful} for subjects,
  and the results might also be harmful. But even in case 1, there could
  be major unintended harmful consequences.
\item
  In cases 1 and 3, however, the ``intervention'' is within the sphere
  of \textbf{normal activities} for the implementer.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Constraint: Is it ethical to manipulate subjects for

\protect\hypertarget{constraint-is-it-ethical-to-manipulate-subjects-for-research-purposes-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Sometimes it is possible to use this point of difference to make a
  ``spheres of ethics'' argument for ``embedded experimentation.''
\item
  \textbf{Spheres of Ethics Argument}: Experimental research that
  involves manipulations that are not normally appropriate for
  researchers may nevertheless be ethical if:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Researchers and implementers agree on a \textbf{division of
    responsibility} where implementers take on responsibility for
    actions
  \item
    Implementers have \textbf{legitimacy} to make these decisions within
    the sphere of the intervention
  \item
    Implementers are indeed \textbf{materially independent} of
    researchers (no swapping hats)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Difficulty with this argument:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Question begging}: How to determine the legitimacy of the
    implementer? (Can we rule out Nazi doctors?)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Otherwise keep focus on consent and desist if this is not possible

  Experiments? No formal journal recognition.

registration}\label{worries-and-myths-around-registration}}

\begin{frame}{Myth: Concerns about fishing presuppose researcher
dishonesty}
\protect\hypertarget{myth-concerns-about-fishing-presuppose-researcher-dishonesty}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Fishing can happen in very subtle ways, and may seem natural and
  justifiable.
\item
  Example:
\end{itemize}

-- I am interested in whether more democratic institutions result in
better educational outcomes. -- I examine the relationship between
institutions and literacy and between institutions and school
attendance. -- The attendance measure is significant and the literacy
one is not. Puzzled, I look more carefully at the literacy measure and
see various outliers and indications of measurement error. As I think
more I realize too that literacy is a slow moving variable and may not
be the best measure anyhow. I move forward and start to analyze the
attendance measure only, perhaps conducting new tests, albeit with the
same data.

\protect\hypertarget{myth-fishing-is-technique-specific}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Frequentists can do it
\item
  Bayesians can do it too.
\item
  Qualitative researchers can also do it.
\item
  You can even do it with descriptive statistics

\begin{frame}{Myth: Registration only makes sense for experimental
studies, not for observational studies}
\protect\hypertarget{myth-registration-only-makes-sense-for-experimental-studies-not-for-observational-studies}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The key distinction is between prospective and retrospective studies.
\item
  Not between experimental and observational studies.
\item
  A reason (from the medical literature) why registration is especially
  important for experiments: because you owe it to subjects
\item
  A reason why registration is less important for experiments: because
  it is more likely that the intended analysis is implied by the design
  in an experimental study. Researcher degrees of freedom may be
  greatest for observational qualitative analyses.

\begin{frame}{Worry: Registration will create administrative burdens for
researchers, reviewers, and journals}
\protect\hypertarget{worry-registration-will-create-administrative-burdens-for-researchers-reviewers-and-journals}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Registration will produce some burden but does not require the
  creation of content that is not needed anyway
\end{itemize}

-- It does shift preparation of analyses forward -- And it also can
increase the burden of developing analyses plans even for projects that
don't work. But that is in part, the point.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upside is that ultimate analyses may be much easier.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Worry: Registration will force people to implement
analyses that they know are wrong}
\protect\hypertarget{worry-registration-will-force-people-to-implement-analyses-that-they-know-are-wrong}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Most arguments for registration in social science advocate for
  non-binding registration, where deviations from designs are possible,
  though they should be described.
\item
  Even if it does not prevent them, a merit of registration is that it
  makes deviations visible.

\begin{frame}{Myth: Replication (or other transparency practices)
obviates the need for registration}
\protect\hypertarget{myth-replication-or-other-transparency-practices-obviates-the-need-for-registration}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are lots of good things to do, including replication.
\item
  Many of these do not substitute for each other. (How to interpret a
  fished replication of a fished analysis?)
\item
  And they may likely act as complements
\item
  Registration can clarify details of design and analysis and ensure
  early preparation of material. Indeed material needed for replication
  may be available even before data collection

scooping}
\protect\hypertarget{worry-registration-will-put-researchers-at-risk-of-scooping}{}

  some period

\begin{frame}{Worry: Registration will kill creativity}
\protect\hypertarget{worry-registration-will-kill-creativity}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is an empirical question. However, under a nonmandatory system
  researchers could:
\item
  Register a plan for structured exploratory analysis
\item
  Decide that exploration is at a sufficiently early stage that no
  substantive registration is possible and proceed without registration.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implications:}
\protect\hypertarget{implications}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In neither case would the creation of a registration facility prevent
  exploration.
\item
  What it might do is make it less credible for someone to claim that
  they have tested a proposition when in fact the proposition was
  developed using the data used to test it.
\item
  Registration communicates when researchers are angage in exploration
  or not. We love exploration and should be proud of it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does registering analyses of historical data make sense?

  with probability 0.8 but if it is false we observe K2 with probability
  0.2 (``double decisiveness'' again)

  We are now 80\% confident in proposition H.
\item
  We decide to look for evidence K2. And we find it!
