## Getting started {#secoutline}

### Plan for today

* General aims and structure
* Expectations
* Pointers for exercises
* Quick `DeclareDesign` intro

### Aims

* Deep understanding of key ideas in causal inference 
* Transportable tools for understanding how to evaluate and improve design
* Applied skills for design and analysis
* Exposure to open science practices
* Deeper dive into some specific topics (see survey)

### Syllabus and resources

* [https://macartan.github.io/ci](https://macartan.github.io/ci) for all resources
* [https://macartan.github.io/ci/syllabus.pdf](https://macartan.github.io/ci/syllabus.pdf)
* Git repo [https://github.com/macartan/ci](https://github.com/macartan/ci)
* [Student survey](https://cloud.wzb.eu/apps/forms/s/8QmokT5GeQfkmkrBHDzrzN4j): Please fill this out today.

Day 5: 

* [5.1	Topics and techniques](#citopics)
* [5.2	Open science](#openscience)




### Expectations {.smaller}

* 5 tasks
* (Required) Work in four "exercise teams": 1 team (and typically 2 exercises) per session $\times 4$ 
* (Optional) Prepare a research design or short paper, perhaps building on existing work. Typically this contains: 
  - a problem statement
  - a description of a method to address the problem
  - analytic or simulation based results describing properties of the solution
  - a discussion of implications for practice. 

A passing paper will illustrate subtle features of a method; a good paper will identify unknown properties of a method; en excellent paper will develop a new method. 

* Plus general reading and participation. 


### Exercise team job {.smaller}

Teams should prepare 15 - 20 minute presentations on set puzzles. Typically the task is to:

* Take a puzzle
* Declare and diagnose a design that shows the issue under study (e.g. some estimator produces unbiased estimates under some condition)
* Modify the design to show behavior when conditions are violated 

* Share a report with the class. Best in self-contained documents for easy third party viewing. e.g. `.html` via `.qmd` or `.Rmd`
* Presentations should be about 10 minutes for a given puzzle.

### Good coding rules

* [https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/r-code-best-practices/](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/r-code-best-practices/)

### Good coding rules 

* Metadata first
* Call packages at the beginning: use `pacman` 
* Put options at the top
* Call all data files once, at the top. Best to call directly from a public archive, when possible.  
* Use functions and define them at the top: comment them; useful sometimes to illustrate what they do
* Replicate first, re-analyze second. Use sections.
* (For replications) Have subsections named after specific tables, figures or analyses


### Aim


* First best: If someone has access to your `.Rmd`/`.qmd` file they can hit render or compile and the whole thing reproduces first time.  So:  Nothing local, everything relative: so please do not include hardcoded paths to your computer

*  But: often you need ancillary files for data and code. That's OK but aims should still be that with a self contained folder someone can open a `main.Rmd` file, hit compile and get everything. I usually have an `input` and an `output` subfolder.


### Collaborative coding / writing

* Do not get in the business of passing attachments around
* Documents in some cloud: `git`, osf, Dropbox, Drive, Nextcloud
* General rule: only post non sensitive, non proprietary material
* Share self contained folders; folders contain a small set of live documents plus an archive. Old versions of documents are in archive. Only one version of the most recent document is in a main folder.
* Data is self contained folder (`in`) and is never edited directly
* Update to github frequently
