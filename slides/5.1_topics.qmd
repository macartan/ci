## Diff in diff

Key idea: the evolution of units in the control group allow you to impute what the evolution of units in the treatment group *would have been* had they not been treated


### Logic {.smaller}

We have group $A$ that enters treatment at some point and group $B$ that never does

The estimate:

$$\hat\tau = (\mathbb{E}[Y^A | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y^A | pre]) -(\mathbb{E}[Y^B | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y^B | pre])$$
(how different is the change in $A$ compared to the change in $B$?)

can be written:

$$\hat\tau = (\mathbb{E}[Y_1^A | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^A | pre]) -(\mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | pre])$$

### Logic {.smaller}
Cleaning up

$$\hat\tau = (\mathbb{E}[Y_1^A | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^A | pre]) -(\mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | pre])$$

$$\hat\tau = (\mathbb{E}[Y_1^A | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^A | post]) + ((\mathbb{E}[Y_0^A | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^A | pre]) -(\mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | post] - \mathbb{E}[Y_0^B | pre]))$$

$$\hat\tau_{ATT} = \tau_{ATT} + \text{Difference in trends}$$



### Simplest case

```{r}
n_units <- 2
design <- 
  declare_model(
    unit = add_level(N = n_units, I = 1:N),
    time = add_level(N = 6, T = 1:N, nest = FALSE),
    obs = cross_levels(by = join_using(unit, time))) +
  declare_model(potential_outcomes(Y ~ I + T^.5 + Z*T)) +
  declare_assignment(Z = 1*(I>(n_units/2))*(T>3)) +
  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y~Z)) + 
  declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0),
                  ATT = mean(Y_Z_1[Z==1] - Y_Z_0[Z==1])) +
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, label = "naive") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + I, label = "FE1") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + as.factor(T), label = "FE2") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + I + as.factor(T), label = "FE3")  


```

### Diagnosis {.smaller}

Here only the two way fixed effects is unbiased and only for the ATT.

The ATT here is averaging over effects for treated units (later periods only). We *know nothing* about the size of effects in earlier periods when all units are in control!



```{r, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
design |> diagnose_design() 
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
if(run)
  design |> 
  redesign(n_units = 10) |>  
  diagnose_design()  |>
  write_rds("saved/dd1.rds") |> kable()

read_rds("saved/dd1.rds") |>
  reshape_diagnosis() |> select(Inquiry, Estimator, Bias) |> kable()

```

### The classic graph

```{r}
design |> 
  draw_data() |>
  ggplot(aes(T, Y, color = unit)) + geom_line() +
       geom_point(aes(T, Y_Z_0)) + theme_bw()
```


### Extends to multiple units easily {.smaller}


```{r, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
design |> redesign(n_units = 10) |> diagnose_design() 
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
if(run)
  design |> 
  redesign(n_units = 10) |>  
  diagnose_design()  |>
  write_rds("saved/dd10.rds")

read_rds("saved/dd10.rds") |>
  reshape_diagnosis() |> select(Inquiry, Estimator, Bias) |> kable()

```

### Extends to multipe units easily


```{r}
design |> 
  redesign(n_units = 10) |>  
  draw_data() |> 
  ggplot(aes(T, Y, color = unit)) + geom_line() +
       geom_point(aes(T, Y_Z_0)) + theme_bw()
```

### In practice

* Need to defend parallel trends
* Most typically using an *event study*
* Sometimes: report balance between treatment and control groups in covariates
* Placebo leads and lags


### Heterogeneity {.smaller}

* Things get much more complicated when there is (a) heterogeneous timing in treatment take up and (b) heterogeneous effects


*  It's only recently been appreciated how tricky things can get

*  But we already have an intuition from our analysis of trials with heterogeneous assignment and heterogeneous effects: 

  * in such cases fixed effects analysis weights stratum level treatment effects by the variance in assignment to treatment
  * something similar here 

### Staggared assignments {.smaller}

Just two units assigned at different times:

```{r}
trend = 0

design <- 
  declare_model(
    unit = add_level(N = 2, ui = rnorm(N), I = 1:N),
    time = add_level(N = 6, ut = rnorm(N), T = 1:N, nest = FALSE),
    obs = cross_levels(by = join_using(unit, time))) +
  declare_model(
    potential_outcomes(Y ~ trend*T + (1+Z)*(I == 2))) +
  declare_assignment(Z = 1*((I == 1) * (T>3) + (I == 2) * (T>5))) +
  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y~Z), 
                      I_c = I - mean(I)) +
  declare_inquiry(mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) +
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, label = "1. naive") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + I, label = "2. FE1") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + as.factor(T), label = "3. FE2") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + I + as.factor(T), label = "4. FE3") + 
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z*I_c + as.factor(T), label = "5. Sat")  
```


### Staggared assignments diagnosis {.smaller}


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
diagnose_design(design, sims = 1) |>
  reshape_diagnosis() |> select(Estimator, 'Mean Estimand', 'Mean Estimate') |> kable()
```


### Where do these numbers come?


* The estimand is .5 -- this comes from weighting the effect for unit 1 (0) and the effect for unit 2 (1) equally

* The naive estimate is wildly off because it does not take into account that units with different treatment shares have different average levels in outcomes

### Where do these numbers come?


* The estimate when we control for unit is 0.36: this comes from weighting the unit-stratum level effects according to the variance of assignment to each stratum:

```{r}
design |> draw_data() |> group_by(unit) |> summarize(var = mean(Z)*(1-mean(Z))) |>
  mutate(weight = var/sum(var)) |> kable()
```

### Where do these numbers come? {.smaller}


* The estimate when we control for time  is -1: this comes from weighting the time-stratum level effects according to the variance of assignment to each stratum
* it weights periods 4 and 5 only and equally, yielding  the difference in outcomes for unit 1 in treatment (0) and group 2 in control (1)
  
```{r}
design |> draw_data()  |> group_by(time) |> summarize(var = mean(Z)*(1-mean(Z))) |>
  mutate(weight = var/sum(var)) |> kable()
```

### Where do these numbers come?

* The estimate when we control for time  *and* unit is 0.25
* This is actually a lot harder to interpret:
  
*  We can figure out what it is from the "Goodman-Bacon decomposition" in [@goodman2021difference](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25018/w25018.pdf)


### Where do these numbers come?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("assets/Goodman-Bacon.png")
```

### Where do these numbers come?

In this case we can think of our data having the following structure:

| |	y1	 |y2 |
|----|----|---|
|pre	|0	|1 |
|mid	|0	|1|
|post	|0	|2|

* the mid to pre diff in diff is (0-0) - (1-1) = 0  (group 2 serves as control)
* the post to mid diff in diff is (2-1) - (0-0) = 1 (group 1 serves as control though already in treatment!)

TWFE gives a weighted average of these two, putting a 3/4 weight on the first and a 1/4 weight on the second

### Two way fixed effects

Specifically:

$$\hat\beta^{DD} = \mu_{12}\hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 1}_{12} +  (1-\mu_{12})\hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 2}_{12}$$
  
where   $\mu_{12} = \frac{1-\overline{Z_1}}{1-(\overline{Z_1}-\overline{Z_2})} =  \frac{1-\frac36}{1-\left(\frac36-\frac16\right)} = \frac34$
  
$$\frac34\hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 1}_{12} +   \frac14 \hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 2}_{12}$$
(weights formula from [WP version](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25018/w25018.pdf))

### Two way fixed effects

And:

* $\hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 1}_{12}$ is $(\overline{y}_1^{MID(1,2)} - \overline{y}_1^{PRE(1)}) - (\overline{y}_2^{MID(1,2)} - \overline{y}_2^{PRE(1)})$ 

which in the simple example without time trends is $(0 - 0) - (1-1) = 0$ 


* $\hat\beta^{2 \times 2, 2}_{12}$ is $(\overline{y}_2^{POST(2)} - \overline{y}_2^{MID(1,2)}) - (\overline{y}_1^{POST(2)} - \overline{y}_1^{MID(1,2)})$ 

which is $(2 - 1) - (0 - 0) = 1$

### A problem

So *quite* complex weighting of different comparisons

* Units effectively get counted as both treatment and control units for different comparisons
* Treated units counted as control units
* Effectively negative weights on some quantities
* Possible to have very poorly performing estimates

### Solutions

* Involve better specification of estimands
* Use of comparisons directly relevant for the estimands
* *Imputation* of control outcomes in treated units using data from appropriate control units only and then targetting estimands directly [@borusyak2021revisiting]
* Particular solution: focus on the effect of treatment *at the time of first treatment* / or *time of switching*: this usually involves a no carryover assumption [@de2020two] also @imai2021use

### Solutions

### Triple differencing

* A response to concerns that double differencing is not enough is to *triple* difference


* When you think that there may be a violation of parallel tends but you have other outcomes that would pick up the same *difference in trends*

* See @olden2022triple

### Triple differencing {.smaller}

You are interested in the effects of influx of refugees on right wing voting 

* You have (say more conservative) states with no refugees at any period
* You have (say more liberal) states with refugees post 2016 only 

You want to do differences in differences comparing these states before and after

* However you worry that things change differntially in the conservative and liberal states: *no parallel trends*

* but you can identify areas *within* states that are more or less likely to be exposed and compare differnces in differences in the exposed and unexposed groups.

### Triple differencing {.smaller}

So:

* Two types of states: $L \in \{0,1\}$, only $L=1$ types get refugee influx
* Two time periods: $Post \in \{0,1\}$, refugee influx occurs in period $Post = 1$
* Two groups: $B \in \{0,1\}$, $B=1$ types affected by refugee influx

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 L + \beta_2 B + \beta_3 Post + \beta_4 LB + \beta_5 L Post + \beta_6 B Post + \beta_7L B Post + \epsilon$$


### Triple differencing

$$\frac{\partial ^3Y}{\partial L \partial B \partial Post} = \beta_7$$


### Can we not just condition on the $B=1$ types?

The level among the $B=1$ types is: 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 L + \beta_2  + \beta_3 Post + \beta_4 L + \beta_5 L Post + \beta_6  Post + \beta_7L  Post + \epsilon$$
If you did simple before / after differences among the $B$ types you would get

$$\Delta Y| L = 1, B = 1 = \beta_3  + \beta_5   + \beta_6   + \beta_7$$
$$\Delta Y| L = 0, B = 1 = \beta_3   + \beta_6$$

### Can we not just condition on the $B=1$ types?

And so if you differenced again you would get:

$$\Delta^2 Y| B = 1 = \beta_5   + \beta_7$$
So the problem is that you have $\beta^5$ in here which corresponds exactly to how $L$ states change over time.

### Triple

But we can figure out $\beta_5$ by doing a diff in diff among the $B$'s.



$$Y|B = 0 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 L +   \beta_3 Post  + \beta_5 L Post$$


$$\Delta^2 Y| B = 0 = \beta_5$$




### Easier to swallow?

* The identifying assumption is that absent treatment the differences in trends between $L=0$ and $L=1$  would be the same for units with $B=0$ and $B=1$.


* See equation 5.4 in @olden2022triple

$$ \left(E[Y_0|L=1, B=1, {\textit {Post}}=1] - E[Y_0|L=1, B=1, {\textit {Post}}=0]\right)  \\
 \quad - \ \left(E[Y_0|L=1, B=0, {\textit {Post}}=1] - E[Y_0|L=1, B=0, {\textit {Post}}=0]\right)  \\
 = \nonumber \\
 \left(E[Y_0|L=0, B=1, {\textit {Post}}=1] - E[Y_0|L=0, B=1, {\textit {Post}}=0]\right)  \\
 \quad - \ \left(E[Y_0|L=0, B=0, {\textit {Post}}=1] - E[Y_0|L=0, B=0, {\textit {Post}}=0]\right)$$


### Easier to swallow?

* In a sense this is *one* parallel trends assumption, not two

* But there are four counterfactual quantities in this expression.

**Puzzle**: Is it possible to have an effect identified by a difference in difference  but  incorrectly by a triple difference design? 

## Survey experiments


* Survey experiments are used to *measure* things: nothing (except answers) should be *changed*!
* If the experiment in the survey is changing things then it is a field experiment in a survey, not a survey experiment


### The list experiment: Motivation

* Multiple survey experimental designs have been generated to make it easier for subjects to answer **sensitive questions**

* The key idea is to use inference rather than measurement.

* Subjects are placed in different conditions and the conditions *affect* the **answers** that are given in such a way that you can infer some underlying quantity of interest

### The list experiment: Motivation

```{r, echo = FALSE, caption = "Questions and values collide in an answer"}
make_model("Z -> Question -> Answer <- Value") |> plot(textcol = "black", nodecol = "lightgrey")

```
This is an obvious DAG but the main point is to be clear that the *Value* is the quantity of interest and the value is not affected by the treatment, *Z*.

### The list experiment: Motivation

The list experiment supposes that:

1. Subjects do not want to give a direct answer to a question
2. They nevertheless are willing to truthfully answer an indirect question

**In other words**: sensitivities notwithstanding, *they are happy for the researcher to make correct inferences about them or their group*


### The list experiment: Strategy {.smaller}

* Respondents are given a short list and a long list.

* The long list differs from the short list in having *one extra item*---the sensitive item

* We ask how many items in each list does a respondent agree with: 

  * $Y_i(0)$ is the number of elements on a short list that a respondent agrees with
  * $Y_i(1)$ is the number of elements on a long list that a respondent agrees with
  * $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ is an indicator for whether an individual agrees with the sensitive item
  * $\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$ is the share of people agreeing with sensitive item



### The list experiment: Simplified example {.smaller}

How many of these do you agree with:

|        | Short list       | Long list          | "Effect"  |
|------|------------------|----------------|--------|
|        | "2+2 = 4"    | "2+2 = 4"                |   |
|        | "2$\times$3 = 6"    | "2$\times$3 = 6"                |   |
|        | "3+6 = 8"    | "Climate change is real" |   |
|        |            | "3+6 = 8"                |   |
| Answer | Y(0) = 2   | Y(1) = 4    |  Y(1) - Y(0) = 0 |


[Note: this is obviously not a good list. Why not?]

### The list experiment: Design

```{r}

declaration_17.3 <-
  declare_model(
    N = 500,
    control_count = rbinom(N, size = 3, prob = 0.5),
    Y_star = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.3),
    potential_outcomes(Y_list ~ Y_star * Z + control_count) 
  ) +
  declare_inquiry(prevalence_rate = mean(Y_star)) +
  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) + 
  declare_measurement(Y_list = reveal_outcomes(Y_list ~ Z)) +
  declare_estimator(Y_list ~ Z, .method = difference_in_means, 
                    inquiry = "prevalence_rate")

diagnosands <- declare_diagnosands(
  bias = mean(estimate - estimand),
  mean_CI_width = mean(conf.high - conf.low)
)
```


### Diagnosis

  write_rds("saved/list1.rds")

read_rds("saved/list1.rds") |>
  reshape_diagnosis() |> select("Design", "Inquiry", "Bias", "Mean CI Width") |> kable()
  

```

### Tradeoffs: is the question really sensitive?


```{r}
declaration_17.4 <- 
  declare_model(
    N = N,
    U = rnorm(N),
    control_count = rbinom(N, size = 3, prob = 0.5),
    Y_star = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.3),
    W = case_when(Y_star == 0 ~ 0L,
                  Y_star == 1 ~ rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = proportion_hiding)),

  ) +

### Diagnosis

```



### Negatively correlated items

* How would estimates be affected if the items selected for the list were *negatively* correlated?
* How would subject protection be affected?


### Negatively correlated items

```{r}
rho <- -.8 

correlated_lists <- 
  declare_model(
    N = 500,
    U = rnorm(N),
    control_1 = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.5),
    control_2 = correlate(given = control_1, rho = rho, draw_binary, prob = 0.5),
    control_count = control_1 + control_2,
    Y_star = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.3),
    potential_outcomes(Y_list ~ Y_star * Z + control_count)
  ) +
  declare_inquiry(prevalence_rate = mean(Y_star)) +
  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) + 
  declare_measurement(Y_list = reveal_outcomes(Y_list ~ Z)) +
  declare_estimator(Y_list ~ Z) 
```

### Negatively correlated items

```{r}
draw_data(correlated_lists) |> ggplot(aes(control_count)) + 
  geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
```

### Negatively correlated items

```{r, eval = FALSE}
correlated_lists |> redesign(rho = c(-.8, 0, .8)) |> diagnose_design()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, height = 2, width = 8}
if(run)
correlated_lists |> redesign(rho = c(-.8, 0, .8)) |> diagnose_design() |>
  write_rds("saved/correlated_list.rds")

read_rds("saved/correlated_list.rds") |> tidy() |> filter(diagnosand == "rmse") |> ggplot(aes(rho, estimate)) + geom_line() + ylim(0, NA) + theme_bw() + ylab("rmse")

```

* These trade-off against each other: the more accuracy you have the less protection you have

### Individual or group effects? {.smaller}

* This is typically used to estimate average *levels*

* However you *can* use it in the obvious way to get average levels for groups: this is equivalent to calculating group level heterogeneous effects

* Extending the idea you can even get *individual level* estimates: for instance you might use causal forests

* You can also use this to estimate the *effect* of an experimental treatment on an item that's measured using a list, without requiring individual level estimates:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Z_i  + \beta_2Long_i + \beta_3Z_iLong_i$$



### Hiders and liars

* Note that here we looked at "hiders" -- people not answering the direct question truthfully

* See @li2019relaxing on bounds when the "no liars" assumption is threatened --- this is about whether people respond truthfully to the list experimental question


## Regression discontintuity

Errors and diagnostics



### Intuition

* The core idea in an RDD design is that if a decision rule assigns units that are *almost identical* to each other to treatment and control conditions then we can infer effects *for those cases* by looking *at those cases*.


See excellent introduction:  @lee2010regression

### Intuition


* Kids born on 31 August start school a year younger than kids born on 1 September: does starting younger help or hurt?

* Kids born on 12 September 1983 are more likely to register Republican than kids born on  10 September 1983: can this identify the effects of registration on long term voting? 

* A district in which Republicans got 50.1% of the vote get a Republican representative while districts in which Republicans got 49.9% of the vote do not: does having a Republican representative make a difference for these districts?



### Argument for identification

Setting:

* Typically the decision is based on a value on a "running variable", $X$. e.g. Treatment if $X > 0$
* The estimand is $\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)|X=x]$

Two arguments:

1. Continuity: $\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|X=x]$ and $\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|X=x]$ are continuous at ($x=0$) in $x$: so  $\lim_{\hat x \rightarrow 0}\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|X=\hat x] = \mathbb{E}[Y(0)|X=\hat 0]$

2. Local randomization: tiny things that determine exact values of $x$ are *as if* random and so we can think of a local experiment around $X=0$.


### Argument for identification

Note: 

* continuity argument requires continuous $x$: granularity
* also builds off a conditional expectation function defined at $X=0$

Exclusion restriction is  *implicit* in continuity: If *something else* happens at the threshold then the conditional expectation functions jump at the thresholds

Implicit: $X$ is exogenous in the sense that units  cannot adjust $X$ in order to be on one or the other side of the threshold 

### Evidence

Typically researchers show:

1. "First stage" results: assignment to treatment does indeed jump at the threshold
2. "ITT": outcomes jump at the threshold
3.  LATE (if fuzzy / imperfect compliance) using IV

### Evidence

Typically researchers show:

In addition:

1. Arguments for no other treatments at the threshold
2. Arguments for no "sorting" at the threshold
3. Evidence for no "heaping" at the threshold (McCrary density test)

Sometimes: 

* argue for why estimates extend beyond the threshold
* exclude points *at* the threshold (!)

### Design

```{r}
library(rdss) # for helper functions
library(rdrobust)

cutoff <- 0.5
bandwidth <- 0.5

control <- function(X) {
  as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = TRUE) %*% c(.7, -.8, .5, 1))}
treatment <- function(X) {
  as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = TRUE) %*% c(0, -1.5, .5, .8)) + .25}

rdd_design <-
  declare_model(
    N = 1000,
    U = rnorm(N, 0, 0.1),
    X = runif(N, 0, 1) + U - cutoff,
    D = 1 * (X > 0),
    Y_D_0 = control(X) + U,
    Y_D_1 = treatment(X) + U
  ) +
  declare_inquiry(LATE = treatment(0) - control(0)) +
  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ D)) + 
  declare_sampling(S = X > -bandwidth & X < bandwidth) +
  declare_estimator(Y ~ D*X, term = "D", label = "lm") + 
  declare_estimator(
    Y, X, 
    term = "Bias-Corrected",
    .method = rdrobust_helper,
    label = "optimal"
  )

```

### RDD Data plotted

Note `rdrobust` implements:

* local polynomial Regression Discontinuity (RD) point estimators
* robust bias-corrected confidence intervals 

See  Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) and related papers `? rdrobust::rdrobust`

### RDD Data plotted

```{r}
rdd_design  |> draw_data() |> ggplot(aes(X, Y, color = factor(D))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(aes(X, Y_D_0)) + geom_smooth(aes(X, Y_D_1)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### RDD diagnosis

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
rdd_design |> diagnose_design()
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
if(run)
  rdd_design |> diagnose_design() |> write_rds("saved/rdd_diagnosis.rds")

read_rds("saved/rdd_diagnosis.rds") |> reshape_diagnosis() |> 
  select(Estimator, 'Mean Estimate', 'Bias', 'SD Estimate', 'Coverage') |> kable()
```

### Bandwidth tradeoff {.smaller}

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
rdd_design |> 
  redesign(bandwidth = seq(from = 0.05, to = 0.5, by = 0.05)) |> 
  diagnose_designs()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8}

if(run)
rdd_design |> 
  redesign(bandwidth = seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.5, by = 0.05)) |> 
  diagnose_designs() |>
  write_rds("saved/rddbandwidth.rds")

read_rds("saved/rddbandwidth.rds")|>  tidy() |>
  filter(diagnosand %in% c("bias", "rmse", "sd_estimate")) |>
  ggplot(aes(bandwidth, estimate, color = diagnosand)) + geom_line()  + theme_bw() +
  facet_grid(~estimator)

```

* As we increase the bandwidth, the lm bias gets worse, but slowly, while the error falls. 
* The best bandwidth is relatively wide. 
* This is more true for the optimal estimator.


### Geographic RDs {.smaller}

Are popular in political science:

* Put a lot of pressure on assumption of no alternative treatment---including "random" country level shocks!
* Put a lot of pressure on no sorting assumptions (why was the border put where it was; why did units settle here or there?)
* Put a lot of pressure on SUTVA: people on one side are literally proximate to people on another

## Noncompliance and the LATE estimand {#LATE}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
model <- make_model("Z -> X -> Y; X <-> Y") 
model |> plot()
```

### LATE---Local Average Treatment Effects {.smaller}

Sometimes you give a medicine but only a nonrandom sample of people actually try to use it. Can you still estimate the medicine's effect?

|     | X=0                           | X=1                           |
|-----|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Z=0 | $\overline{y}_{00}$ ($n_{00}$) | $\overline{y}_{01}$ ($n_{01}$) |
| Z=1 | $\overline{y}_{10}$ ($n_{10}$) | $\overline{y}_{11}$ ($n_{11}$) |

Say that people are one of 3 types:

1.  $n_a$ "always takers" have $X=1$ no matter what and have average outcome $\overline{y}_a$
2.  $n_n$ "never takers" have $X=0$ no matter what with outcome $\overline{y}_n$
3.  $n_c$ "compliers have" $X=Z$ and average outcomes $\overline{y}^1_c$ if treated and $\overline{y}^0_c$ if not.

| Z=1 | $\overline{y}_{10}$ (n\_{10}) | $\overline{y}_{11}$ (n\_{11}) |

We can figure something about types:

### LATE---Local Average Treatment Effects  {.smaller}

You give a medicine to 50% but only a non random sample of people actually try to use it. Can you still estimate the medicine's effect?

|         | $X=0$                                                                           | $X=1$                                                                             |
|---------|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| $Z=0$ | $\frac{n_c}{n_c + n_n} \overline{y}^0_{c}+\frac{n_n}{n_c + n_n} \overline{y}_n$ | $\overline{y}_{a}$ |
| \(n\) | ($\frac{1}{2}(n_c + n_n)$)                                                      | ($\frac{1}{2}n_a$)  |
| $Z=1$ | $\overline{y}_{n}$                  | $\frac{n_c}{n_c + n_a} \overline{y}^1_{c}+\frac{n_a}{n_c + n_a} \overline{y}_{a}$ |

Average in $Z=0$ group: $\frac{{n_c} \overline{y}^0_{c}+ \left(n_{n}\overline{y}_{n} +{n_a} \overline{y}_a\right)}{n_a+n_c+n_n}$

Average in $Z=1$ group: $\frac{{n_c} \overline{y}^1_{c} + \left(n_{n}\overline{y}_{n} +{n_a} \overline{y}_a \right)}{n_a+n_c+n_n}$

Difference: $ITT = ({\overline{y}^1_c-\overline{y}^0_c})\frac{n_c}{n} \rightarrow LATE = ITT\times\frac{n}{n_c}$

### The good and the bad of LATE  {.smaller}

-   You get a well-defined estimate even when there is non-random take-up
-   May sometimes be used to assess mediation or knock-on effects
-   But:
    -   You need assumptions (monotonicity and the exclusion restriction -- *where were these used above*?)
    -   Your estimate is only for a subpopulation
    -   The subpopulation is not chosen by you and is unknown
    -   Different encouragements may yield different estimates since they may encourage different subgroups

              given = list("X[Z=1] > X[Z=0]", TRUE),
              using = "posteriors") 
```

       restricted =  make_model("Z -> X -> Y; X <-> Y") |>

    write_rds("saved/lipids_again.rds")

read_rds("saved/lipids_again.rds") |> select(model, query, mean, sd) |> arrange(query) |> kable(digits = 2)
```


In one case we *assume* monotonicty, in the other we **update** on it (easy in this case because of the empirically verifiable nature of one sided non compliance)


## Spillovers {#SUTVA}

### SUTVA violations (Spillovers)

Spillovers can result in the estimation of weaker effects when effects are actually stronger.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
par(mfrow=c(2,1)); X=c("Control", "Treatment")
barplot(c(0,4), names.arg=X, main="No spillovers. Total effect = 4, Estimated Effect = 4");  
barplot(c(3,4), names.arg=X, main="With spillovers. Total effect = 7, Estimated Effect = 1")
arrows(2,3,.75,2, lwd=2)
```

The key problem is that $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ are not sufficient to describe potential outcomes

-   The key is to think through the structure of spillovers.
-   Here immediate neighbors are exposed
-   In this case we can **define a direct treatment** (being exposed) and **an indirect treatment** (having a neighbor exposed) and we can work out *the* ***propensity*** *for each unit of receiving each type of treatment*
-   These may be non uniform (here central types are more likely to have teated neighbors); but we can still use the randomization to assess effects

**Idea**: You can use the design to get a handle on spillovers

### Spillovers: Opportunities and Warnings

You can in principle:

* debias estimates
* learn about interesting processes
* optimize design parameters

But  to estimate effects you still need *some* SUTVA like assumption.

### Spillovers: Opportunities and Warnings

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/neelan.png")
```

In this example if one compared the outcome between treated units and all control units that are at least $n$ positions away from a treated unit you will get the wrong answer unless $n \geq 7$.



## Mediation {#mediation}

### The problem of unidentified mediators

-   Consider a causal system like the below.
-   The effect of X on M1 and M2 can be measured in the usual way.
-   But unfortunately, if there are multiple mediators, the effect of M1 (or M2) on Y is not identified.
-   The 'exclusion restriction' is obviously violated when there are multiple mediators (unless you can account for them all).

```

### The problem of unidentified mediators  {.smaller}

An obvious approach is to first examine the (average) effect of X on M1 and then use another manipulation to examine the (average) effect of M1 on Y. 

* But **both of these average effects may be positive (for example) even if there is no effect of X on Y through M1**.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

### The problem of unidentified mediators {.smaller}

An obvious approach is to first examine the (average) effect of X on M1 and then use another manipulation to examine the (average) effect of M1 on Y. 

* Similarly **both of these average effects may be zero even if X affects on Y through M1 for every unit!**

```{r, echo = FALSE}

### The problem of unidentified mediators  {.smaller}

* Another somewhat obvious approach is to see how the effect of $X$ on $Y$ in a regression is reduced when you control for $M$. 

* If the effect of $X$ on $Y$ passes through $M$ then surely there should be no effect of $X$ on $Y$ after you control for $M$. 

* This common strategy associated with @baron1986moderator is also not guaranteed to produce reliable results. See for instance @green2010enough

### The problem of unidentified mediators: Quantities  {.smaller}

-   In the potential outcomes framework we can describe a **mediation effect** as (see Imai et al): $$\delta_i(t) = Y_i(t, M_i(1)) - Y_i(t, M_i(0)) \textbf{ for } t = 0,1$$
-   The **direct effect** is: $$\psi_i(t) = Y_i(1, M_i(t)) - Y_i(0, M_i(t)) \textbf{ for } t = 0,1$$
-   This is a **decomposition**, since: $$Y_i(1, M_i(1))  - Y_1(0, M_i(0)) = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_i(1) + \delta_i(0) + \psi_i(1) + \psi_i(0))  $$
-   If (and a big if), there are no interaction effects---ie $\delta_i(1) = \delta_i(0), \psi_i(1) = \psi_i(0)$, then $$Y_i(1, M_i(1))  - Y_1(0, M_i(0)) = \delta_i  + \psi_i$$
-   The bad news is that although a single experiment might identify the total effect, it can not identify these elements of the direct effect.

### The problem of unidentified mediators: Solutions?  {.smaller}

-   Check **formal requirement** for identification under single experiment design ("sequential ignorability"---that, conditional on actual treatment, it is as if the value of the mediation variable is randomly assigned relative to potential outcomes). But this is strong (and in fact unverifiable) and if it does not hold, bounds on effects always include zero (Imai et al)
-   You can use **interactions** with covariates **if you are willing to make assumptions on no heterogeneity of direct treatment effects** over covariates. eg you think that money makes people get to work faster because they can buy better cars; you look at the marginal effect of more money on time to work for people with and without cars and find it higher for the latter. This might imply mediation through transport but only if there is no direct effect heterogeneity (eg people with cars are less motivated by money).

### The problem of unidentified mediators: Solutions?

-   Weaker assumptions justify **parallel design**
    -   Group A: $T$ is randomly assigned, $M$ left free.
    -   Group B: divided into four groups $T\times M$ (requires two more assumptions (1) that the **manipulation** of the mediator only affects outcomes through the mediator (2) **no interaction**, for each unit, $Y(1,m)-Y(0,m) = Y(1,m')-Y(0,m')$.)

**Takeaway**: Understanding mechanisms is harder than you think. Figure out what assumptions fly.


### In `CausalQueries`

Lets imagine that sequential ignorability does not hold. What are our posteriors on mediation quantities when in fact all effects are mediated, effects are strong, and we have  lots of data?

```{r}
model <- make_model("X -> M ->Y <- X; M <-> Y")

plot(model)

```


### In `CausalQueries`

We imagine a true model and consider estimands:

```{r}
truth <- make_model("X -> M ->Y") |> 
  set_parameters(c(.5, .5, .1, 0, .8, .1, .1, 0, .8, .1))

queries  <- 
  list(
      indirect = "Y[X = 1, M = M[X=1]] - Y[X = 1, M = M[X=0]]",
      direct = "Y[X = 1, M = M[X=0]] - Y[X = 0, M = M[X=0]]"
      )

truth |> query_model(queries) |> kable()
```

### In `CausalQueries` {.smaller}

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model |> update_model(data = truth |> make_data(n = 1000)) |>
  query_distribution(queries = queries, using = "posteriors") 
  
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

if(run)
model |> update_model(data = truth |> make_data(n = 1000), iter = 5000) |>
  write_rds("saved/cq-mediation.rds")

read_rds("saved/cq-mediation.rds") |> 
    query_distribution(queries = queries, using = "posteriors") |>
  gather(var, val) |> 
  ggplot(aes(val)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(~var)  + xlab("posterior")
```

Why such poor behavior? Why isn't weight going onto indirect effects?

Turns out the data *is* consistent with direct effects only: specifically that whenever $M$ is responsive to $X$, $Y$ is responsive to $X$.

```{r, include = FALSE}
read_rds("saved/cq-mediation.rds")$posterior_distribution |> apply(2, mean)
```
